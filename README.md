# LibraryAttendance

LibraryAttendance is a rewrite of [LibraryAttendanceProgram](https://github.com/DCHSProgrammingClub/LibraryAttendanceProgram), write might be a better word though.

## Deploy

To build the site use `deploy <server>` and set the server.
This will write to localhost.

Before building the php files in `config/` need to be created from the examples.

## Dependencies

This project uses Bootstrap, jQuery, js-cookie, and sb-admin.
There are all in compressed forms in `js/` and `css/`.
