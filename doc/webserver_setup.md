# Webserver Setup

Apache2 .htaccess files should be allowed to override the site wide settings.

The server needs to properly supply GET, POST and COOKIE objects.
SERVER REQUEST_URI needs to show the full URL.

deploy script needs to be configured for the server directory.

Other than the .htaccess files everything should work instantly with the defaults.
